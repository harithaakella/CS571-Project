Section I. Team organization and Buddy Rating

(1)	Tasks division and each member’s work in detail :

We are a team of four with expertise in different domains. Our initial challenge was selecting the programming language which we all together have decided that, we shall develop a stand-alone application in Java programming language. Haritha was the only one who had Java background. But, the team performed unexceptional hard work taking up the challenge of learning a new language and left no stone unturned in achieving the same. We had our daily standup meetings over phone and every Wednesday we arranged a face-to face meeting and discussed about what we did? What we are going to do? And where we lag? We were successful in following the scrum methodology in the best possible way with each of us being the scrum master for a week.

Nithish is working in this group as a group coordinator. He has done most of the game board and controller tasks. For game board, he ***************. He had done eight hours of pair programming with other group members. He did mostly game board testing and some of the refactoring.
Ujwal has done the programing of the ****** classes. He included *****************. He covered eight hours pair programming with other team members. He made some test cases for user interface class and also did some refactoring.
Harish mostly worked in ********** class. He has done research in finding some useful logic. He did eight hours pair programming with other group members. He also mostly performed the testing part *************
Savin did not have much experience in Java programming. He provided valuable response in group meeting and also helped to find out appropriate solution. He mostly did testing part. ****************** and also did eight hours pair programming with other team members.
Haritha created a repository in Github and also arranged every group meeting following the agile practices. She has done a lot of research and shared the logic and useful IEEE paper journals with the team. She put front the idea of implementing the program using MVC framework.Since, she has much experience in user interface, did most of User Interface and GUI task in this project. She helped refactor some of the java code and worked on ********** classes. She has also done the documentation and managed to do eight hours pair programming with other team members.
